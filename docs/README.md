# Fioup - OTA Update Client for FoundriesFactory

Fioup is an OTA update client that performs container-only management
of Linux-based operating systems. It is similar to the
[aktualizr-lite](https://github.com/foundriesio/aktualizr-lite) project
but does not perform operating system updates.

It is built on-top of a battle-tested container orchestation project,
[composeapp](https://github.com/foundriesio/composeapp).

## Getting Started

* [Installing fioup](./install.md)
* [Registering a device](./register-device.md)
* [Performing an update](./update-device.md)
* [Daemon mode](./daemon-mode.md)

## How It Works
